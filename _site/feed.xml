<p>I am terribly excited because I tried, years ago, to get Jekyll up and running on my MacBook Air (hereinafter known as “Tenkuu”), and I just couldn’t do it. I don’t know the technical aspects of that failure.</p>

<p>But today, a more confident me tried again, and here we are!</p>

<p>(That newfound confidence likely comes from two sources: thyroid hormone replacement of the natural, desiccated variety;  and learning more about Git and Github via both <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Chacon and Straub’s <em>Pro Git</em></a>.)</p>

<p>(I recommend only the learning to the general public.)</p>

<p>Yay, Jekyll! Yay, Github! Yay, me!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post was written in iA Writer and saved directly to the Jekyll _posts folder in my local Documents directory.
