This post was written in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and saved directly to the Jekyll ```_posts``` folder in my local Documents directory. It took only minor tweaking to get the document for this post correctly formatted. (Looking at the source for the sample post included with any Jekyll-generated site is a great way to see how your own posts should be formatted.)

I am terribly excited because I tried, years ago, to get Jekyll up and running on my MacBook Air (hereinafter known as "Tenkuu"), and I just couldn't do it. I don't know the technical aspects of that failure. 

But today, a more confident me tried again, and here we are!

(That newfound confidence likely comes from two sources: thyroid hormone replacement of the natural, desiccated variety;  and learning more about Git and Github via both [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Chacon and Straub's _Pro Git_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).) 

(I recommend only the learning to the general public.)

Yay, Jekyll! Yay, Github! Yay, me!
