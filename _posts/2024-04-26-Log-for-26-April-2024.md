* Completed the Python 3 Magic 8_ball project on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Fun! But I wish I knew how to turn that code into a usable thing, with inputs and an existence outside of my code editor.
* Completed Python 3 shipping calculator project at Codecademy.
* Reviewed syntax errors and name errors, and learned about type errors and logic errors in Python.
* Started an independent Python project only to realize how difficult it can be to get accurate, useable data.
* Began learning about lists and methods in Python.
