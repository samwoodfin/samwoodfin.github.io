* Learned about slicing and sorting lists in Python
* Spent extra time practicing manipulating lists because:

I am confused by how using the ```.insert()``` method to insert a list element at index -2 actually places that element at index -3, while the item previously at index -2 is _still_ at index -2. Meanwhile, if I insert the same item at index 2, it lands at index 2, causing the former index 2 item to shift to index 3. The takeaway here, I think, is that ```.insert()``` causes everything to the right of the insertion to shift further to the right.
