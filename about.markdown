This Jekyll site was built by a Jekyll, Git, and Github n00b. It uses Minima, the base Jekyll theme. The site owner will eventually find out more info about customizing her Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

The source code for Minima resides at GitHub:

The source code for Jekyll resides at GitHub, too:
